# BasicPayrollCS - C#
A project I took from the earlier days of College and customized it just for fun...like the C++ varient.

# Basic Usage:
```
.\payroll
.\payroll 1 or true
.\payroll 0 or false
```
# Explanation (Above)
```
> Like the C++ version, the binary 1 switch can mean 'true' and the binary 0 switch can mean 'false'. So, if the user
enters a 1 or true as a parameter, then whatever the user enters into the prompts will be displayed back to them. If the
user enters a 0 as the parameter, then the prompt values will not be displayed after validation.
